# MultiSearch_AI_Agent
This repository houses a Multi-Search AI Agent capable of querying diverse information sources, including Wikipedia, the web, arXiv research papers, and a FAISS vector database.  Leveraging the power of Llama 3.2 for text generation and OpenAI's function-calling capabilities.

Multi-Search AI Agent
This project implements a Multi-Search AI Agent designed to effectively retrieve and synthesize information from various sources. It utilizes Llama 3.2 for text generation, OpenAI's function calling mechanism for tool selection, and LangChain for agent execution.

Features
Diverse Search Capabilities: Integrates specialized tools for searching:
Wikipedia
Web Search (e.g., using Google Search API)
arXiv Research Papers
FAISS Vector Database (for semantic search)
Intelligent Tool Selection: Employs OpenAI's function calling to dynamically choose the most appropriate tool(s) based on the user's query.
Llama 3.2 Integration: Leverages the advanced text generation capabilities of Llama 3.2 to provide comprehensive and informative responses.
LangChain Framework: Utilizes LangChain for streamlined agent creation, tool management, and execution.
Extensible Architecture: Designed for easy addition of new search tools and customization of the agent's behavior.
Installation
Bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/multi-search-ai-agent.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd multi-search-ai-agent

# Install dependencies (replace with your actual dependencies)
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Configure API Keys: Set up your API keys for the required services (e.g., OpenAI, Google Search API, etc.) and store them securely (e.g., environment variables).
Run the Agent: Execute the main script to interact with the agent.
Bash

python main.py
Provide Queries: Input your queries through the command line or a user interface (if implemented). The agent will intelligently select the appropriate tools and generate a response.
Example
User: What are the latest advancements in large language models for medical diagnosis, and how do they compare to traditional methods?

Agent: (The agent will use a combination of arXiv, web search, and potentially Wikipedia to gather information and generate a comprehensive response.)
Architecture
The agent follows a modular architecture:

User Query: The user provides a query to the agent.
Tool Selection: The OpenAI function calling mechanism, guided by the Llama 3.2 model, determines which tool(s) are best suited to answer the query.
Tool Execution: The selected tool(s) are executed, retrieving relevant information.
Response Generation: The Llama 3.2 model synthesizes the retrieved information and generates a natural language response.
Output: The agent presents the generated response to the user.
